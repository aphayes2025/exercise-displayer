# Exercise Displayer - created by Aidan Hayes
I created an exercise displayer in order to help a user work on their workout goals. I got inspiration from the app Strava. 
The user inputs a txt file and I parse information from the user to help show them their workouts and important graphs
which helps show them their progress they have been making.
